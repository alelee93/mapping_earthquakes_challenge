## Mapping Earthquakes

### Overview

The purpose of this challenge is to create an interactive earthquake map with two differetnt maps and the earthquake overlay using JavaScript, Leaflet.js, and geoJSON data.

### Results

- The map displays tectonic plate data and major earthquake data using d3.json() and the geoJSON() layer.
- The tectonic plate LineString data is set to stand out on the map, and the tectonic plate data is added to the overlay object with the earthquake data.
- The map sets the radius of the circle markers based on the magnitude of earthquake, and includes a popup marker for each earthquake that displays the magnitude and location of the earthquake using the GeoJSON layer, geoJSON().
- The map is available in dark mode.
